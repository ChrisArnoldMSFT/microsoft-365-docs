# Set up Microsoft Viva Learning (Preview) in the Teams admin center

> [!NOTE]
> The information in this article relates to a preview product that may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. 

The Teams admin installs Viva Learning (Preview) and applies permission policies through the Teams admin center.

1. For Public Preview, you must first set the Update policy. For more details, see the Teams site [Microsoft Teams Public Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/public-preview-doc-updates).

    1. Sign in to the Teams admin center.

    2. Select **Teams** > **Update policies**.

    3. Select **Add**. 

    4. Name the update policy, add a policy, and turn on **Show preview features**.

2. The admin must notify users of the policy update so that they move their build into Public Preview for Teams. 

    1. User must select their profile image --> About --> Public Preview.

    2. User must accept terms of Public Preview.

3. For organizations that have restrictive policies and need to enable Viva Learning, they would then follow the flows that we’ve already outlined in the next section.

## Manage settings for Viva Learning (Preview)

You must be an administrator in the Teams admin center to perform these tasks.

To make Viva Learning (Preview) available for users in your organization, follow these steps:

1. In the left navigation of the Teams admin center, go to **Teams apps** > **Manage apps**.

2. On the **Manage apps** page, in the search box, type *Viva learning*, and then select **Viva Learning (Preview)**.

3. On the **Viva Learning (Preview)** page:

   1. Under **Status**, select **Allowed** to turn on Viva Learning (Preview).

   2. On the **Settings** tab, under **App settings**, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center to [configure learning content sources](content-sources-365-admin-center.md).

   ![Learning page in the Teams admin center showing Status and App settings section.](../media/learning/learning-app-teams-learning-page.png)

4. After **Manage app** settings, go to **Permission policies** and **Setup policies** to grant permission to employees who should have access to Viva Learning (Preview) as part of your organization's participation in the preview.

> [!NOTE]
>  If your organization is in Ring 4.0 as part of Teams TAP100 program, you might need to enable approved users in Ring 3.0 to access Viva Learning (Preview). <br><br>As part of the preview, Viva Learning (Preview) is released in Ring 3.0. If your organization is in Ring 4.0, you won’t see Viva Learning (Preview) on the **Manage apps** page. To test the app, you need to create a custom apps permission policy, set it to **Allow all apps**, and assign it to Ring 3.0 approved users. <br><br>   ![TAP-AppsPermission-Plcy page showing Allow all apps selected.](../media/learning/learning-app-tap-appspermission-plcy.png)
